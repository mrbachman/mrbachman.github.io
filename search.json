    "title": "How much does my professor swear?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s the first day of class. We all wander in, wondering what kind of professor we are going to be subject to for the next 16 weeks. The professor rolls in at 9:30 a.m., which is on time, but isn’t there a saying about ‘if you’re on time, you’re late’?\nAnyway, in the opening remarks, the professor talks about the class. The normal usual. But then, they swore. Then again. And again. And all of a sudden, the professor had the attention of the class. And they said, “If you have a problem with swearing, you might have a problem with this class.” Or something like that.\nThis sparked an idea. I’m in a data class. My professor said we’ll be creating a data project later on in the semester. So, let’s put my professor’s theory to the test. How much do they swear?\nI started by tallying the total amount they swore each class period. But that wasn’t quite giving me the data I wanted. So, I broke it down a little further into which swear words they were using each class period. And that got me somewhere. But first, let’s take a look at how often my professor swore during each class period.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncursewords &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/Matt Waite's Potty Mouth - Waite Swear Words.csv\")\ngoodmood &lt;- cursewords |&gt;\n  filter(Total &lt; 17)\nbadmood &lt;- cursewords |&gt;\n  filter(Total &gt;= 17)\n\ncursewords |&gt;\n  ggplot() + geom_bar(data=cursewords, aes(x=reorder(Date, Total), weight=Total)) +\n  geom_bar(data=goodmood, aes(x=reorder(Date, Total), weight=Total), fill=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=badmood, aes(x=reorder(Date, Total), weight=Total), fill=\"black\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\",\n    y=\"Number of times professor cursed\",\n    title=\"True to their word, my professor does have a sailor mouth\",\n    subtitle=\"My professor's swearing varied by the class (and maybe mood)\",\n    caption=\"Source: Kelby Bachman | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=16, y=24, label=\"Huskers Lose?\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6, y=17, label=\"Huskers Win?\"), color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMy professor wasn’t wrong. They, in fact, do swear quite a bit. I wasn’t sure if it because the Huskers won or lost. Either way, safe to say my professor has a sailor mouth. I took it a step further. Yeah, my professor swears a lot. But I wondered if he preferred one word over another. And, as a matter of fact, it seems like they do.\n\n\nCode\ncursewords |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=cursewords, aes(x=Fuck, y=Date, size=Fuck, color=\"Fuck\")) +\n  geom_point(data=cursewords, aes(x=Shit, y=Date, size=Shit, color=\"Shit\")) +\n  geom_point(data=cursewords, aes(x=Bitch, y=Date, size=Bitch)) +\n  geom_point(data=cursewords, aes(x=Ass, y=Date, size=Ass)) +\n  geom_point(data=cursewords, aes(x=Hell, y=Date, size=Hell)) +\n  geom_point(data=cursewords, aes(x=Damn, y=Date, size=Damn)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Swear Words\",\n    y=\"Date\",\n    size=\"Total\",\n    title=\"Swear words aren't as intimidating when they're in color\",\n    subtitle=\"One thing's for sure, Fuck & Shit are my professor's swear words of choice\",\n    caption=\"Source: Kelby Bachman | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears my professor’s preferred words are “Fuck” and “Shit”. That makes sense. I mean, those are pretty versatile curse words. I was a little surprise by the margin at which they were used over the others. So, I decided to find the percent to see what the likelihood he was going to drop an F-bomb compared to the other swear words.\n\n\nCode\ncursewordspct &lt;- cursewords |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Fuck=sum(Fuck),\n    Shit=sum(Shit),\n    Hell=sum(Hell),\n    Damn=sum(Damn),\n    Bitch=sum(Bitch),\n    Ass=sum(Ass),\n    Total=sum(Total)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    FuckPCT=round((Fuck/Total)*100, digits=2),\n    ShitPCT=round((Shit/Total)*100, digits=2),\n    HellPCT=round((Hell/Total)*100, digits=2),\n    DamnPCT=round((Damn/Total)*100, digits=2),\n    BitchPCT=round((Bitch/Total)*100, digits=2),\n    AssPCT=round((Ass/Total)*100, digits=2)\n  )\n\ncursebar &lt;- cursewordspct |&gt;\n  select(ends_with(\"PCT\")) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=ends_with(\"PCT\"), names_to = \"Word\", values_to=\"Percent\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Word = gsub(\"PCT\", \"\", Word))\n\nfuckbar &lt;- cursebar |&gt;\n  filter(Word == \"Fuck\")  \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=cursebar, aes(x=Word, weight=Percent), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=fuckbar, aes(x=Word, weight=Percent), fill=\"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Swear Words\",\n    y=\"Percent\",\n    size=\"Percent\",\n    title=\"My professor swear words based on percent\",\n    subtitle=\"When my professor does swear, they are going to say 'Fuck' almost half the time\",\n    caption=\"Source: Kelby Bachman | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it. If, I guess I should say when, my professor swears, they are going to drop an F-bomb almost half the time. Shit is a close second. The others…well, they might be best used as “sentence enhancers”. At least that’s what Patrick Star calls them. Now, go out and see how much your professor swears."

    "text": "Offense. A seven-letter word that everyone loves. No matter what sport it is, we all love offense. Baseball, basketball, wrestling, tennis, etc. Offense makes things exciting. Unless your an Iowa football fan. Then you’d rather see punting and defense. And you’re totally fine with that (for the most part). Would it kill Iowa to at least try and be more creative on offense? Spice things up a bit? Nevermind. Back to the point.\nAs awful, putrid, pathetic, etc. as the Iowa offense has been, the defense has been the exact opposite. They’ve been dominant, aggressive, the backbone of the entire team. I would even say ELITE. Yes, that’s right. The Iowa defense is (and has been) ELITE. Over the last five years, I might go as far as to say they are the best in the nation, especially given how awful the offense has been. Let’s take a look at the data.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\noffense2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/R Studio/total_offense_2019.csv\")\noffense2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_offense_2020.csv\")\noffense2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_offense_2021.csv\")\noffense2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_offense_2022.csv\")\noffense2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_offense_2023.csv\")\ndefense2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_defense_2019.csv\")\ndefense2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_defense_2020.csv\")\ndefense2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_defense_2021.csv\")\ndefense2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_defense_2022.csv\")\ndefense2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/total_defense_2023.csv\")\n\noffense &lt;- bind_rows(offense2019, offense2020, offense2021, offense2022, offense2023)\ndefense &lt;- bind_rows(defense2019, defense2020, defense2021, defense2022, defense2023)\n\niowa &lt;- offense |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Iowa\")\n\niowa |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=iowa, aes(x=Rk, y=Pts)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Rank\",\n    y=\"Offense PPG\",\n    size=\"Total\",\n    title=\"Rank of Offense by Points\",\n    subtitle=\"Iowa's offense is laughably bad\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Ref. | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, at one point, the Iowa offense did average almost 32 PPG, good enough to rank 40th in the nation. Oh, but did I mention that was the COVID year? So maybe put an asterisk next to that year. Remove that year and they have ranked 87, 99, 123 and 124. Ouch. So how about the defense? How good have they been?\n\n\nCode\niowad &lt;- defense |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Iowa\")\n\niowad |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=iowad, aes(x=Rk, y=Pts)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Rank\",\n    y=\"Defense PPG Allowed\",\n    size=\"Total\",\n    title=\"Rank of defense by points allowed\",\n    subtitle=\"Iowa's defense is pretty freaking good\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Ref. | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, they’ve been really good. They’ve ranked 5th, 6th, 13th, 2nd and 4th. It’s hard to put into words how remarkable those numbers are when you look at how bad the offense has been. The offense cannot sustain drives. They can’t put points on the board. But the defense just doesn’t let the other team score, either. So, how does this compare with other teams from around the country? Let’s have a look.\n\n\nCode\niowad |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=defense, aes(x=Rk, y=Pts)) +\n  geom_point(data=iowad, aes(x=Rk, y=Pts), color=\"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Rank\",\n    y=\"Defense PPG Allowed\",\n    size=\"Total\",\n    title=\"Iowa D among the best\",\n    subtitle=\"Over the last 5 years, Iowa's D has been one of the best\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Ref. | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nI know, I know. I chose red for a color. But that’s because yellow doesn’t show up as well. But the point is, over the last five years, the defense has been one of the best in the country. When you take into account at how the offense has been one of the worst in the country, it only magnifies how ridiculously good the defense has been."
