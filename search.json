We all wander in, wondering what kind of professor we are going to be subject to for the next 16 weeks. The professor rolls in at 9:30 a.m., which is on time, but isn’t there a saying about ‘if you’re on time, you’re late’?\nAnyway, in the opening remarks, the professor talks about the class. The normal usual. But then, they swore. Then again. And again. And all of a sudden, the professor had the attention of the class. And they said, “If you have a problem with swearing, you might have a problem with this class.” Or something like that.\nThis sparked an idea. I’m in a data class. My professor said we’ll be creating a data project later on in the semester. So, let’s put my professor’s theory to the test. How much do they swear?\nI started by tallying the total amount they swore each class period. But that wasn’t quite giving me the data I wanted. So, I broke it down a little further into which swear words they were using each class period. And that got me somewhere. But first, let’s take a look at how often my professor swore during each class period.\n\n\nCode\ncursewords &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/Matt Waite's Potty Mouth - Waite Swear Words.csv\")\ngoodmood &lt;- cursewords |&gt;\n  filter(Total &lt; 17)\nbadmood &lt;- cursewords |&gt;\n  filter(Total &gt;= 17)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncursewords |&gt;\n  ggplot() + geom_bar(data=cursewords, aes(x=reorder(Date, Total), weight=Total)) +\n  geom_bar(data=goodmood, aes(x=reorder(Date, Total), weight=Total), fill=\"gold\") +\n  geom_bar(data=badmood, aes(x=reorder(Date, Total), weight=Total), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\",\n    y=\"Number of times professor cursed\",\n    title=\"True to their word, my professor does have a sailor mouth\",\n    subtitle=\"My professor's swearing varied by the class (and maybe mood)\",\n    caption=\"Source: Kelby Bachman | By Kelby Bachman\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=17, y=24, label=\"Bad Mood?\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6, y=17, label=\"Good Mood?\"), color=\"gold\")"
