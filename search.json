The professor rolls in at 9:30 a.m., which is on time, but isn’t there a saying about ‘if you’re on time, you’re late’? Anyway, in the opening remarks, the professor talks about the class. The normal usual. But then, they swore. Then again. And again. And all of a sudden, the professor had the attention of the class. And they said, “If you have a problem with swearing, you might have a problem with this class.” Or something like that."
